    This knowledge-base was developed by Charlie Bell. It is a 'template' knowledge-base
    designed to demonstrate some of the features
    of the FSC Identikit.
    Most of the examples in the documentation describing how to build a knowledge-base
    refer to this knowledge-base.
    If you are building a completely
    new knowledge-base, consider making a copy of this template as
    a starting point for your work.
